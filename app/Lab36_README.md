# Lab 36 Persistent Map App

## Feature Tasks
Create an app that loads a map view and allows users to pan around and zoomin
and out. Your app should persist it's own state so users alaways see where they
last left off.

This app includes:
* A zoom in button
* A zoom out button
* A button to toggle through at least two different map view types
* A button that takes the user to one of your favorite places
